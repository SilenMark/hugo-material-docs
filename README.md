## Quick start

Install with `git`:


    git clone https://github.com/SilenMark/hugo-theme-material.git


Next, take a look in the `exampleSite` folder at. This directory contains an example config file and the content for the demo. It serves as an example setup for your documentation. 

Copy at least the `config.toml` in the root directory of your website. Overwrite the existing config file if necessary. 

Hugo includes a development server, so you can view your changes as you go -
very handy. Spin it up with the following command:

``` sh
hugo server
```

Now you can go to [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and the Material
theme should be visible. For detailed installation instructions visit the [The original demo](http://themes.gohugo.io/theme/material-docs/).
